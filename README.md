Required software installed:
- Node.js
- VIsual Studio Code

How to run tests:
1. Navigate to the `cypress-template` folder via the Command Prompt.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies required by the project. These dependencies are declared in your `package.json` file. This command will create a `node_modules` folder.
3. Run `npx cypress run` - (this will execute all tests without opening a web browser), or `npx cypress open` - this will open the Cypress Explorer where you can select specific tests or run them all. You will be able to see your tests run in the browser here.
